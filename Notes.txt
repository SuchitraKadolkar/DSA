- To get all divisors of a number check number % number from 1 to sqrt(number) equals to 0
- log10(n)+1 returns count of digits in an integer number
- sum of first n natural numbers:= N(N+1)/2
- xor of number with itself results in zero. To calculate missing number in an array of first N numbers
    do xor of all array elements and xor of all elements from 1 to N, then again do xor of these two,
    it will give missing number or else we can use sum of first N natural numbers approach also
- In array, every element is repeated twice except one, to find this we can do xor of all array elements
    which will give the resultant output.
- If the length of string is N, then there can be N*(N+1)/2 possible substrings.
- Subarrays are contiguous array elements on the other hand subsequence can be created using any elements
    from the array.
    Ex- arr=[-1,2,4,5,1,5,0] then Subarrays will be [2,4,5], [5,1,5,0], [-1,2,4]
        and subsequence will be [-1,5,4], [0,2,1]


- Subarrays sum equals k (prefixsum approach looking for k check s-k in map)
